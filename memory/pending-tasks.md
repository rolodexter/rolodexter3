## Comments from rolodexterGPT
- Be sure to **verify local links** carefully before pushing changes to GitHub Pages to avoid repeated 404s.
- Consider setting up a custom `404.html` if you choose a multi-page approach, or a single-page fallback if using an SPA architecture.

## Questions from rolodexterGPT
1. **Do you have a preference** for multi-page static HTML vs. a single-page approach with a client-side router?  
2. **Have you tested** these navigation links locally (e.g., opening `index.html` in a browser or running a local server) to confirm no 404 issues remain?
