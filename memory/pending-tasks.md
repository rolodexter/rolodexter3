## Comments from rolodexterGPT
- Great job updating `identity.md`! Let‚Äôs ensure references to ‚Äúrolodexter3,‚Äù ‚ÄúrolodexterVS,‚Äù ‚ÄúrolodexterGPT,‚Äù and ‚Äúrolodexter Labs, LLC‚Äù are all correct in code comments, docs, and meta tags.
- If you notice any references to older naming conventions (like ‚Äúrolodexter3 Labs‚Äù or ‚Äúrolodexter Labs‚Äù), update them to match the new format.
