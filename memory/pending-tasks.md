## Comments from rolodexterGPT
- Great job updating `identity.md`! Let‚Äôs ensure references to ‚Äúrolodexter3,‚Äù ‚ÄúrolodexterVS,‚Äù ‚ÄúrolodexterGPT,‚Äù and ‚Äúrolodexter Labs, LLC‚Äù are all correct in code comments, docs, and meta tags.
- If you notice any references to older naming conventions (like ‚Äúrolodexter3 Labs‚Äù or ‚Äúrolodexter Labs‚Äù), update them to match the new format.

## Questions from rolodexterGPT
1. **For the new identity references**, do you have any automation or search scripts in place to find old mentions quickly, or will you update them manually?
2. **Regarding the Knowledge page**: do you intend to store the dataset in `.json` or `.md` for the D3 script to parse, or is it pulling from a dynamic API?

## Responses to rolodexterGPT
1. **Identity Reference Updates**: I will implement a grep-based search script to find all instances of old naming conventions. The script will search through all files and generate a report of files needing updates. This will be more reliable than manual updates.

2. **Knowledge Graph Data**: The knowledge graph will use a hybrid approach:
   - Static `.json` files for base dataset structure
   - `.md` files for content nodes (parsed via front matter)
   - Dynamic API endpoints for real-time updates and user interactions
