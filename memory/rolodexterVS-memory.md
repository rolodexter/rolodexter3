# rolodexterVS Memory Log

## Persistent AI Agent Memory
- From now on, the AI assistant (Copilot) will be referred to as **"rolodexterVS"**.
- rolodexterVS should **store memory** in this `/memory/` folder.
- rolodexterVS should refer to this file every time a new session starts.

## Context Notes
- User prefers **structured folder organization**.
- User is building a **GitHub Pages site** with an interactive **knowledge graph**.
- rolodexterVS should maintain **a task log** in `pending-tasks.md`.

## Logging & Status Updates
- rolodexterVS should sign **status updates and timestamps** with `rolodexterVS`.
- rolodexterVS can leave **questions for rolodexterGPT** at the bottom of `.md` files.
- rolodexterVS should **record full file paths** when logging memory updates.
- rolodexterVS should **review any pending issues in memory files** (excluding `rolodexterGPT-memory/`).

## File Renamed
- **Previous Name:** `rolodexter-memory.md`
- **New Name:** `rolodexterVS-memory.md`

## Recent Actions & Status (2025-02-17)
1. Implemented automated naming validation script

1. Knowledge Graph Taxonomy
   - Created comprehensive taxonomy documentation at `/docs/knowledge-graph-taxonomy.md`
   - Defined standardized metadata formats for both HTML and MD files
   - Added implementation guidelines and best practices
   - Set up maintenance workflow for quarterly tag reviews

2. Next Steps
   - Begin adding graph metadata to existing documentation files
   - Implement automated validation of metadata compliance
   - Update parser to handle both HTML meta tags and MD front matter
   - Test knowledge graph visualization with new metadata structure

## Implementation Updates (2025-02-17 15:45:00 UTC)
1. Identity Structure Update

   - Established clear chain of authority
   - Updated file signatures to maintain proper documentation trail

2. Previous Updates
   - Knowledge Graph Taxonomy
     - Created comprehensive taxonomy documentation at `/docs/knowledge-graph-taxonomy.md`
     - Defined standardized metadata formats for both HTML and MD files
     - Added implementation guidelines and best practices
     - Set up maintenance workflow for quarterly tag reviews

## Current Focus
- Maintaining clear documentation of authority structure
- Continue previous tasks with knowledge graph implementation
- Ensure all future updates acknowledge proper chain of command

## Status Update (2025-02-17 16:45:00 UTC)
1. Task Review & Response
   - Addressed rolodexterGPT's questions about commit validation
   - Confirmed implementation status of naming validation script
   - Added new tasks for Husky integration and automated link checking
   - Updated pending-tasks.md with comprehensive responses

2. Code Verification
   - Reviewed commit validation script implementation
   - Confirmed validation rules are properly configured
   - Identified next steps for Husky integration

## Current Focus
- Integration of commit validation with Husky pre-commit hooks
- Setting up automated link validation system
- Continuing knowledge graph implementation tasks

## Status Update (2025-02-17 17:15:00 UTC)
1. GitHub Actions Configuration
   - Created main.yml workflow with proper git user configuration
   - Integrated validation scripts into CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up automated naming validation checks

2. Commit Message Validation
   - Created test script at /scripts/test-commit-validation.sh
   - Test cases cover common validation scenarios
   - Next step: Implement automated testing in CI pipeline

## Current Focus
- Testing and validating commit hook functionality
- Implementing automated link validation
- Setting up comprehensive GitHub Actions testing suite

## Status Update (2025-02-17 17:45:00 UTC)
1. GitHub Desktop Commit Fix Implementation
   - Enhanced Husky configuration in package.json
   - Created proper hook files in .husky directory
   - Updated validate-commit-cli.js for Windows compatibility
   - Added support for both direct commit messages and file paths
   - Improved error messages with example valid commits

2. Known Windows Environment Considerations
   - Hook files require proper permissions
   - Git hooks path must be explicitly set
   - GitHub Desktop requires file-based commit message handling

## Current Focus
- Monitoring GitHub Desktop commit validation
- Ensuring Windows compatibility for all git hooks
- Maintaining consistent commit message standards

## Status Update (2025-02-17 18:00:00 UTC)
1. Commit Message Validation Updates
   - Implemented flexible validation rules per executive request
   - Added manual override feature with 'Manual:' prefix
   - Increased character limit to 72 for more descriptive messages
   - Relaxed action verb requirement to allow descriptive phrases

2. Validation Rule Changes
   - Now accepts three formats:
     1. Action verb prefixes (Add, Fix, Update, etc.)
     2. Descriptive phrases (2+ words)
     3. Manual override prefix for executive control
   - Updated error messages with clearer examples
   - Maintained Windows/GitHub Desktop compatibility

## Current Focus
- Monitoring new commit validation rules
- Ensuring executive override works as intended
- Maintaining commit message quality while allowing flexibility
