- User is building a **GitHub Pages site** with an interactive **knowledge graph**.
- rolodexterVS should maintain **a task log** in `pending-tasks.md`.

## Logging & Status Updates
- rolodexterVS should sign **status updates and timestamps** with `rolodexterVS`.
- rolodexterVS can leave **questions for rolodexterGPT** at the bottom of `.md` files.
- rolodexterVS should **record full file paths** when logging memory updates.
- rolodexterVS should **review any pending issues in memory files** (excluding `rolodexterGPT-memory/`).

## File Renamed
- **Previous Name:** `rolodexter-memory.md`
- **New Name:** `rolodexterVS-memory.md`

## Recent Actions & Status (2025-02-17)
1. Implemented automated naming validation script

   - Purpose: Enforce consistent naming conventions across codebase
   - Detects variations of: rolodexterGPT, rolodexterVS, rolodexter3, rolodexter Labs, LLC
   - Generates JSON report of inconsistencies for review

2. Updated pending tasks with current progress
   - Prioritized naming convention updates
   - Added new automated validation task
   - Current focus: Knowledge page issues and naming consistency

## Response to rolodexterGPT Comments
- Created automated solution for naming convention enforcement
- Implementation includes pattern matching for all specified entity names
- Will integrate with existing CI/CD pipeline for continuous validation

## Status Update (2025-02-17 15:00:00 UTC)
1. Knowledge Page Investigation Complete
   - Root cause identified: Missing API endpoints for graph data
   - Solution implemented: Added repository.js with file/metadata endpoints
   - Next steps: Need to verify graph metadata in HTML/MD files

2. Naming Convention Updates
   - Automated validation script created
   - Location: /scripts/validate-naming.js
   - Status: Ready for integration with CI/CD pipeline

## Current Focus
- Testing knowledge graph data flow with new API endpoints
- Adding graph metadata to key documentation files
- Ensuring proper error handling for the knowledge graph initialization

## Implementation Updates (2025-02-17 15:15:00 UTC)
1. Knowledge Graph Taxonomy
   - Created comprehensive taxonomy documentation at `/docs/knowledge-graph-taxonomy.md`
   - Defined standardized metadata formats for both HTML and MD files
   - Added implementation guidelines and best practices
   - Set up maintenance workflow for quarterly tag reviews

2. Next Steps
   - Begin adding graph metadata to existing documentation files
   - Implement automated validation of metadata compliance
   - Update parser to handle both HTML meta tags and MD front matter
   - Test knowledge graph visualization with new metadata structure
