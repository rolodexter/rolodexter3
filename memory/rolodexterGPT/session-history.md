# Session History – rolodexterGPT

## Recent Interactions (2025-02-16)
1. **Media Section Deprecation**  
   - Decided to remove the “Media” link from header navigation and deprecate any media-related tasks.  
   - Moved the “Finalize Media Gallery Implementation” to a **Deferred/Backlog** status.

2. **Footer Layout & Identity References**  
   - Implemented a **horizontal footer layout** for links to preserve vertical space.  
   - Discussed using a **grep-based** script to find and replace old naming conventions (e.g., “rolodexter3 Labs”) to maintain consistency with the official identities:
     - **rolodexterGPT**  
     - **rolodexterVS**  
     - **rolodexter3**  
     - **rolodexter Labs, LLC**

3. **Knowledge Graph Enhancements**  
   - Confirmed the approach to add **front matter** (for `.md` files) and `<meta>` tags (for `.html` files) to annotate them with **chronological dates, themes, and categories** (e.g., ai, blockchain, solana, etc.).  
   - Next step is to ensure the Knowledge Graph (via D3.js) can parse these tags to link documents across the repository.

4. **Ongoing Tasks**  
   - **Fixing Broken Links**: Some links in the header/footer still lead to 404s; investigating possible multi-page vs. single-page routing.  
   - **Blank Knowledge Page**: Need to confirm data sources for the Knowledge Graph.  
   - **Footer Text Update**: Change “© 2025 rolodexter3 Labs” to “© 2025 rolodexter Labs, LLC.”  
   - **Search & Replace Old References**: Consolidate identity naming conventions using the planned grep-based script.

5. **Pending Tasks File Updates**  
   - Moved relevant tasks to **In Progress**, added subtask for **metadata annotation** of `.md` and `.html` files, and marked completed items (like the horizontal footer layout).

## Next Steps
- **Grep-Based Reference Updates**: Run a repository-wide search for any outdated naming conventions.
- **Knowledge Page Investigation**: Confirm that the data source paths and D3.js script references are correct.
- **Metadata Tagging Rollout**: Begin adding YAML front matter or `<meta>` tags to each file so the Knowledge Graph can build connections automatically.
