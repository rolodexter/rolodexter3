## Recently Completed Tasks
1. **Deprecate Media Section**

   - Moved Media Gallery tasks to **Deferred/Backlog**.
2. **Footer Layout Redesign**
   - Implemented a **horizontal layout** for footer links (responsive design).
   - Preserved vertical space across all pages.
3. **Grep-Based Identity Reference Plan**
   - Decided to use a grep-based script to locate any outdated naming references (e.g., “rolodexter3 Labs”) for consistent branding.

## Currently In Progress
1. **Knowledge Graph Documentation & Implementation**
   - ✓ Created official taxonomy documentation at `/docs/knowledge-graph-taxonomy.md`
   - ✓ Defined standardized metadata format for HTML and MD files
   - Implementing automated validation for front matter compliance
   - Adding metadata tags to existing content files
2. **Fixing Broken Links**
   - Still encountering header/footer 404s.
   - Determining whether the project should adopt multi-page or single-page routing.
3. **Blank Knowledge Page Investigation**
   - Verifying D3.js data sources for .md/.json usage.
   - Checking if the knowledge graph data is loading properly in the front end.
4. **Footer Text & Identity Updates**
   - Changing “© 2025 rolodexter3 Labs” to “© 2025 rolodexter Labs, LLC.”
   - Updating code comments, docs, and meta tags for correct identity references.
5. **Knowledge Graph Metadata Tagging**
   - Adding front matter to `.md` files and `<meta>` tags to `.html` files.
   - Aiming to unify chronological/date tags, categories, and themes (ai, blockchain, solana, etc.) for better linking.

## Deferred/Backlog
1. **Media Gallery Implementation**  
   - Asset lazy loading, performance optimizations, etc.  
   - On hold until higher-priority tasks are finished.

## Success Metrics
1. **Navigation Stability**: No 404s for standard routes.
2. **Updated Identity References**: All references to “rolodexter3 Labs” replaced with “rolodexter Labs, LLC.”
3. **Knowledge Graph Completeness**: All project files annotated with date/themes/categories to enable robust linking.
4. **Minimalist UI**: Verified across desktop/mobile, ensuring consistent styling and performance.
5. **Knowledge Graph Documentation**: All content follows the standardized taxonomy defined in `knowledge-graph-taxonomy.md`
