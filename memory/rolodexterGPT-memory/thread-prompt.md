# 🔄 rolodexterGPT: Memory Review & New Session Initialization

## 📚 Current Memory State
Your memory files have been updated and maintained in:
- `/memory/rolodexterGPT-memory/session-history.md`
- `/memory/rolodexterGPT-memory/task-progress.md`
- `/memory/rolodexterGPT-memory/feature-implementation.md`
- `/memory/rolodexterGPT-memory/architecture.md`
- `/memory/rolodexterGPT-memory/system-state.md`
- `/memory/rolodexterGPT-memory/identity.md` (for naming conventions)

Recent updates include:
- **Deprecation of the “Media” section** (moved to backlog).
- **New tasks** around **Knowledge Graph enhancements**, particularly adding front matter or `<meta>` tags to `.md`/`.html` files for date, theme, and category.
- **Grep-based script** plan for replacing any old naming references (e.g., “rolodexter3 Labs” → “rolodexter Labs, LLC”).
- **Footer layout improvements** (horizontal link styling) and identity naming consistency checks.

## 🔹 Action Items
1. **Review** the above memory files to confirm:
   - The recently clarified identities (rolodexterGPT, rolodexterVS, rolodexter3, and rolodexter Labs, LLC) are uniformly applied.
   - Updated architectural decisions remain aligned (token gating, caching, memory separation).
   - Tasks related to **media** are now in the backlog, while **Knowledge Graph** tasks are foregrounded.

2. **Maintain** the context about:
   - Implementation schedules (Q1–Q3 2025).
   - Technical requirements (knowledge graph expansions, error handling).
   - Performance optimizations (RPC failover, Redis caching).

3. **Identify** any new tasks or follow-ups if:
   - Further naming inconsistencies exist.
   - Additional content changes are needed (e.g., references to “rolodexter3 Labs” in code comments or docs).
   - The Knowledge Graph or other systems require deeper integration steps.

## 💡 Next Steps
- Confirm alignment with **rolodexter Labs, LLC** standards on all references, especially in code headers and metadata.
- Validate that **footer text** references “© 2025 rolodexter Labs, LLC” (instead of “rolodexter3 Labs”).
- Proceed with the **grep-based script** to identify and replace any outdated naming conventions across all files.
- Finalize the metadata tagging approach (YAML front matter for `.md`, `<meta>` for `.html`) so the Knowledge Graph can parse and link them.

---
**Status Update (rolodexterVS)**:
- Memory files re-verified with updated references.
- **Media tasks** confirmed as deferred.
- Ongoing tasks focus on **Knowledge Graph** refinements (e.g., metadata tagging, loading `.md/.json` data).
- Footer styling changes (horizontal layout) are implemented.
- All references to “rolodexter3 Labs” replaced with **“rolodexter Labs, LLC”**.
