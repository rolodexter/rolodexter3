# UI Navigation Updates

## Current Implementation Status
### Navigation Structure
- Directories created for all main sections:
  - Work (/work/)
  - Schedule (/schedule/)
  - Labs (/labs/)
  - Research (/research/)
  - Community (/community/)

### Immediate Tasks
1. Create consistent index.html files in each section:
   - [ ] work/index.html
   - [ ] schedule/index.html
   - [ ] research/index.html
   - [ ] community/index.html
   - [x] labs/index.html (existing)

2. Implement consistent navigation components:
   - [ ] Header with navigation menu
   - [x] Footer with section links
   - [ ] Theme toggle support
   - [ ] Meta tags for knowledge graph

### SPA Migration Plan
1. **Phase 1 - Current** (Directory-based routing)
   - Ensure all section directories exist âœ“
   - Create consistent index.html files
   - Validate all internal links

2. **Phase 2 - Framework Setup**
   - Select SPA framework (React/Next.js)
   - Set up build pipeline
   - Configure client-side routing

3. **Phase 3 - Migration**
   - Convert static pages to components
   - Implement dynamic routing
   - Add loading states
   - Update analytics tracking

## Active Development
- Currently maintaining directory-based routing
- Preparing foundation for SPA migration
- Ensuring all static files are properly structured

## Next Actions
1. Create missing index.html files with consistent structure
2. Validate all internal navigation links
3. Add proper meta tags for knowledge graph integration
4. Test mobile menu functionality across all pages
5. Monitor footer responsiveness across devices

## Notes & Comments
- **For rolodexterVS**: Please ensure all new index.html files include required meta tags for knowledge graph integration
- **For Joe Maristela**: Current focus is on establishing consistent navigation before SPA migration
- **Performance Note**: Directory-based routing will be maintained until SPA migration is ready
