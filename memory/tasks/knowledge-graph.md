# 🌐 Interactive Knowledge Graph Implementation

## **📌 Overview**
The goal is to develop an **interactive knowledge graph** for the rolodexter website that:
- Uses **D3.js** for data visualization.
- Dynamically loads **Markdown-based knowledge** from `/knowledge/`.
- Enables **graph-based search and exploration** of concepts, entities, and relationships.
- Provides **a seamless, user-friendly experience** with interactive node expansion.

---

## ✅ **Core Features**
### **1️⃣ Graph UI & Visualization**
- [ ] Implement **interactive graph nodes** using **D3.js**.
- [ ] Support **click-based node expansion** for hierarchical navigation.
- [ ] Ensure **graph responsiveness** (adjust to different screen sizes).
- [ ] Style nodes and links using a **cyberpunk aesthetic** to match rolodexter’s branding.
- [ ] Implement **hover tooltips** with contextual info on each node.
- [ ] Provide a **search bar** to filter and highlight nodes.

### **2️⃣ Knowledge Base Integration**
- [ ] Load data from **Markdown files (`.md`)** stored in `/knowledge/`.
- [ ] Parse Markdown content to extract **title, summary, relationships, and metadata**.
- [ ] Convert structured Markdown knowledge into a **graph database format**.
- [ ] Implement **JSON-based knowledge storage** for better performance.

### **3️⃣ Graph Data Processing**
- [ ] Design a **graph schema** for linking concepts.
- [ ] Define **entity types** (e.g., "Concept," "Technology," "Person").
- [ ] Ensure graph **auto-updates when new `.md` files are added**.
- [ ] Implement **relationship extraction** (e.g., linking related concepts).

### **4️⃣ Search & Navigation**
- [ ] Implement **search bar** for quick entity lookup.
- [ ] Enable **keyboard navigation** (arrow keys for node traversal).
- [ ] Allow **graph filtering by category** (e.g., "Research", "AI", "Blockchain").
- [ ] Implement **highlighting of active node paths**.

### **5️⃣ API & Backend Considerations**
- [ ] Provide an **API endpoint** for retrieving knowledge graph data.
- [ ] Cache frequently accessed graph structures for performance.
- [ ] Ensure **knowledge retrieval works with the chatbot integration**.

## **🔄 Data Processing Flow**
1️⃣ **Markdown Parsing:**  
- Extract **title, summary, relationships** from `/knowledge/*.md`.

2️⃣ **Graph Generation:**  
- Convert extracted data into a **graph-based JSON format**.

3️⃣ **Rendering with D3.js:**  
- Display nodes, links, and labels dynamically.

4️⃣ **User Interaction:**  
- Clicking expands nodes, hovering shows details, search filters content.

## **🔹 Example JSON Graph Format**
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "AI", "label": "Artificial Intelligence", "type": "Concept" },
    { "id": "GPT-4", "label": "GPT-4", "type": "Technology" }
  ],
  "links": [
    { "source": "AI", "target": "GPT-4", "relationship": "advancement_of" }
  ]
}
```
