# ðŸ“‚ Deprecated Task Files

This directory stores task files that are no longer relevant.
These tasks have been completed, merged, or replaced with newer versions.

## Archival Policy
- Tasks that are **no longer actively tracked** are moved here
- Outdated `.md` task logs are archived but not deleted immediately
- If a task becomes relevant again, it may be **restored to `/tasks/`**

## Structure
- Legacy tasks are organized by completion date
- Each task maintains its original metadata and completion status
- Cross-references to related active tasks are preserved

## File Management
- When moving a task here:
  1. Update its status to "deprecated" in metadata
  2. Add a deprecation notice at the top
  3. Update any references in active tasks
  4. Document the reason for deprecation

## Retention Guidelines
- Task files are kept for 6 months after deprecation
- Historical context and decisions are preserved
- Files may be permanently removed after review
