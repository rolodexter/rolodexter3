# ðŸ“‚ Deprecated Memory Files

This directory contains memory files that are no longer in active use.
These files have been archived for reference but are not part of the active system.

## Archival Guidelines
- Deprecated memory logs are moved here instead of being deleted
- If a deprecated memory file is **no longer needed**, it may be permanently removed after six months
- References to these files should be updated or redirected

## Structure
- `old-session-logs.md` â†’ (Replaced by `session-history.html`)
- `legacy-memory-system.md` â†’ (Deprecated and merged into `memory-system.html`)

## File Management
- Files in this directory maintain their original metadata for tracking purposes
- Each deprecated file should include a note at the top indicating:
  - When it was deprecated
  - Why it was deprecated
  - Where to find the current/replacement content
  - Who made the deprecation decision
