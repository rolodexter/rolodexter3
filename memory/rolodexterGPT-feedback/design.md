# 🎨 **rolodexterGPT Design Feedback**  

## **🛠 Current Issues**  
The current UI design does not align with the intended **minimalist and document-like** aesthetic. The following issues should be addressed:  

- **Overly Stylized Elements**: The existing theme has high-contrast colors, unnecessary gradients, and cyberpunk-style elements that do not enhance usability.  
- **Cluttered Layout**: The structure needs to be **cleaner and more intuitive**, focusing on readability.  
- **Cookie Banner Prominence**: The cookie policy pop-up is too large and disrupts the user experience. It should be less intrusive.

## **🚀 Recommended Changes**  

### **1️⃣ Minimalist UI Overhaul**
- Shift to a **document-style layout**, keeping the focus on text content rather than visuals.  
- Maintain a **clean, structured interface** that is easy to scan and navigate.  
- Remove unnecessary textures, shadows, and animations.  

### **2️⃣ Improved Light/Dark Mode**
- **Light Mode**: White background, black text, minimal styling (resembles a well-formatted document).  
- **Dark Mode**: Soft gray or black background with off-white text, keeping the document-like structure intact.  

### **3️⃣ Typography & Readability**
- Use **Inter, Roboto, or Source Sans Pro** for better readability.  
- Increase line height and paragraph spacing for improved clarity.  

### **4️⃣ Navigation & Footer Refinements**
- Replace current styling with a **more subtle, document-like approach**.  
- Reduce the prominence of footer elements and remove excess styling.  

### **5️⃣ Adjust Cookie Banner Placement**
- Move the **cookie policy banner** to a **less obtrusive** location.  
- Use a **smaller, subtle banner** instead of a modal-style pop-up.
